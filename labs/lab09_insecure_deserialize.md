# Lab 09 — Insecure Deserialization

**Objective:** Understand dangers of deserializing untrusted data (pickle) in Python.

**Constraints**
- Do not run untrusted pickles you don't understand — it's dangerous.

**Hints**
- The admin page includes a pickle deserialization endpoint.
- Replace pickle with JSON and validate data.

**Learning outcomes**
- Replace unsafe deserialization with safe patterns and input validation.
